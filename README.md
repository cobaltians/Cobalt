#Cobalt 

## Installation Guide

First, have a look on this brief technical [introduction to Cobalt](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/cobalt-intro) to understand basic principles of the framework.

Then, you are ready to start.

###1) Install Android Studio or XCode

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (mac users only)

This step can take some time. If you already have them on your computer, be sure to have latest XCode version and lastest SDK and JDK for Android Studio.

###2) Install Cobalt

    npm install -g cobaltians
       
This assume you have [Node Package Manager **LTS**](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Use sudo if needed.

###3) Create your app from a sample

Choose a name and a base sample to create your first app :

    cobaltians create myApp HelloWorld
    
This will ask if you want to create the corresponding iOS and Android projects.

Available samples are for example "HelloWorld" or "Catalog". Read more about them [here](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/Samples-list).

###4) Open the generated iOS or Android project and enjoy !

Alternatively you can add Cobalt to an existing project :

* [Add Cobalt to my Android project](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/Android-Setup)
* [Add Cobalt to my iOS project](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/iOS-Setup)
