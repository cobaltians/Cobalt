#Cobalt 

## Installation Guide

First, have a look on this brief technical [introduction to Cobalt](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/cobalt-intro) to understand basic principles of the framework.

Then, you are ready to start.

###1) Install Android Studio or XCode

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (mac users only)

This step can take some time. If you already have them on your computer, be sure to have latest XCode version and lastest SDK and JDK for Android Studio.

###2) Install Git if not already on your system

* [install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
       

###3) Try out a sample

Choose a [sample](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/Samples-list) between `HelloWorld`, `SideMenu`, `Catalog` and `git clone` it for your platform :

    git clone https://github.com/Cobaltians-Samples/Samples-HelloWorld-Android.git
    //or
    git clone https://github.com/Cobaltians-Samples/Samples-HelloWorld-iOS.git
    
Then **go to the cloned folder** and don't forget to init git submodules : 

    git submodule update --init


###4) Open the iOS or Android project and enjoy !

Alternatively you can add Cobalt to an existing project :

* [Add Cobalt to my Android project](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/Android-Setup)
* [Add Cobalt to my iOS project](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/iOS-Setup)
